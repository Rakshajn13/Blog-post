            <h1 class="story-title">Two remarkable examples of dark matter evidence</h1>
            <p class="story-text">The most popular and the first evidence in history was the “flat rotation curve”
                in galaxies that shows, in contrast to what gravitational theory anticipates, similar velocities 
                of the stars in the middle of the galaxy as well as in the periphery. This fact indicates that an
                extra amount of mass, different from “normal matter,” must be included to increase the gravitational
                pull. Otherwise, the peripheral stars would fly away like projectiles.</p>

            <p class="story-text">High precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
                an ancient light emitted when the universe was very young (around 300,000 years old), 
                have shown that additional “exotic matter” is necessary to describe what we observe in its
                structure.</p>

            <h1 class="story-title">The Roads to Dark Matter</h1>

            <p class="story-text">Scientists are still puzzled about the nature of dark matter.
                Different models are being studied, especially from a particle physics approach.
                However, other theoretical frameworks not derived from particle physics are gaining
                attention, possibly opening up alternative answers to the same problem.
                In this article, I discuss the dark matter problem and three different perspectives 
                of solution.</p>

            <p class="story-text">The dark matter problem arises from a survey of astronomical observations
                indicating that most structures in the universe have a “missed mass.” 
                In other words, the observed mass is different from that predicted by the theory.</p>

            <h1 class="story-title">Dark Particles</h1>
            <p class="story-text">The remarkable achievements of the Standard Model of subatomic particles
                in the last decades suggest that particle physics is the preferred framework to
                guide the discussión. The scientific literature is plagued with models 
                that introduce new particle candidates with different masses and ways
                of interaction with regular matter, among other properties.</p>
            <p class="story-text">The most attractive proposal is the Weakly Interacting 
                Slim Particle (WIMP) model, in which a complete history of the universe,
                including dark matter, can be accomplished by the inclusion of a massive particle
                (heavier than an electron) that interacts extremely weakly with the other
                standard model particles. These properties are necessary to produce a “dark particle” 
                that does not generate light meanwhile producing an extra amount of gravity.</p>

            <h1 class="story-title">Will monkeypox cause Covid-like pandemic?</h1>   
            <p class="story-text">WHO has recorded more than 90 cases of monkeypox in a dozen countries including Canada, Spain, 
                Israel, France, Switzerland, the US and Australia. While US President Joe Biden said that the sudden rise in cases 
                of monkeypox was something to be concerned about, top US health experts have said that it will not cause a 
                Covid-19-like pandemic in the world. Dr. Faheem Younus, Vice President and Chief Quality Officer at the University
                of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health said that while monkeypox cases are concerning but the risk of this becoming a
                Covid-like pandemic is zero per cent. He added that the monkeypox virus is not novel unlike 
                SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19). The world has known about Monkeypox for decades and has a deep understanding 
                of the disease that belongs to the same virus family as smallpox. Dr. Faheem further added that the monkeypox
                virus is typically not deadly and is less contagious than coronavirus.
