          <p class="story">One ticket to Paris please, 5 words I never thought I'd hear myself say again. I was 16 when I associated Paris with
             love. Yes, you can blame the media, you can blame the internet, but I thank them. I discussed running away to Paris with my boyfriend
              of 6 years. He'd always say, We'll go for our honeymoon when we get married. Somewhere that bothered me. I felt strangled, I wanted to
               live and he was holding me back.</p>

            <h1 class="heading"> Tuscany, Italy </h1>
            <img class="photo" src="https://www.storypick.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FF-travel-3.jpg" alt="Italy">
            <p class="story">Graduation was upon us and I couldn't wait to get out of here. Our tickets were booked, bags were packed, we were going
                 to Italy! A girls trip is just what I had wanted, away from all the underage, immature boys.
                It was backpacking all the way, only AirBnB accommodations, our train tickets were as cheap as the Rajdhani tickets and we were going
                 to be all over the country for 20 days. I'd made lists, endless lists with a load of tourist attractions and posh pubs. It could easily 
                 have been an amateur's Lonely Planet.
